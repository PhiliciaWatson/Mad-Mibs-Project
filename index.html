    You were driving through the woods until you saw <b>A person</b> you were startled then crashed into 
    a tree.<br/> When you awoke from being unconscious your first words were "<b>Phrase</b>" You get out your car and
    noticed that you were in <b>A place</b>. <br/>You walk ahead and see spot bloodly path you freak out and attempt to 
    run the other way until you hear something in the other direction.<br/> It sounded like someone...<b>eating</b> ?!<br/> You said "<b>Phrase</b>"
    and went <b>back or forward</b> until you spotted a figure in the distance.<br/> It looks like <b>A person</b> you move slightly
    but you accidently step on a twig; it alerts them.<br/> They turn around and see what they were eating was <b>Food</b>
suddenly they...<b>vanished</b> ?! The ground caves in under your feet up end up in <b>A place</b>.<br/> You then see <b>A person</b>
at a table with <b>Hoilday</b> decorations they then ask,<br/>"Wanna join my tea party?".
